          <h2>who is zed? </h2>
          <p>Zed is a complex character from League of Legends, initially an orphaned boy named Govos who was adopted by the Kinkou Order.
            He later becomes disillusioned with the order's teachings and forms the Order of Shadow, embracing forbidden shadow magic to defend Ionia against Noxus.
            Zed is a skilled warrior and strategist, but also ruthless and merciless, willing to do whatever it takes to protect his nation, even if it means betraying his former allies and embracing dark power. </p>

          <h2>Why Zed?</h2>
          <p>In my opinion, Zed is the coolest and most fun to play champion in the game, even though his learning curve is very high, it is rewarding when you master his play style. His skins are also is the coolest.</p>
